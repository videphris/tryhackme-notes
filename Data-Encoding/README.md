> 1–2 lines describing the main learning objective.
Understand data encoding methods such as ASCII and Unicode

### Quick TL;DR
*One sentence summary of what I did or found.*
Understood how binary (the computer's language) mapped to encoding standard like ASCII and Unicode via bits.
Hexadecimal is used primarily for humans to read bits more easily and is standard in ASCII.

### Key commands
Anything worth keeping.
Not applicable, perhaps using encoding calculators

### What confused me / slowed me down
Understanding the entire lines of UTF (Unicode Transformation Format) U-8 U-16 U-32
This is used to store unicode points into bytes (what computers understand)

### Key takeaway
One thing to remember next time.
Remember
Binary = computer's language
Decimal = Human's language
Hexadecimal - allows humans to understand binary
Unicode = encoding standard that includes multiple languages and symbols. More universal and interoperable.
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Exchange= English letter encoding
